# musa-508-2023-final
Final project for MUSA 508 (Public Policy Analytics), 2023

Michael says:
- be more specific about user + what they do with the information bc that will matter re: outputs
- difference versus modeling at the parcel level versus areal unity (e.g., census tract)
- could also model this as the property level--could model counts, could model likelihood
- is a linear model appropriate here?
- consider time component--do we care about what happens in a year, five years, next council term?
